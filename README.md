# TypeScript Type Error: 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error and its solution. The `bug.ts` file contains code that attempts to pass an array of strings to a function expecting a single string. This results in a type error. The solution, in `bugSolution.ts`, shows how to correctly handle this scenario using type checking and array manipulation.
